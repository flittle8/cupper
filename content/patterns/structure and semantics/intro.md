The contents in this section are in no significant order - where you choose to begin is up to you. What's important is that you check that each of these components are properly marked up in the book.

TALK ABOUT WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT

Our goal is to create a book that uses meaningful HTML markup to indicate page structure and text language.  Meaningful HTML markup makes it easier for users of assistive technology to understand the book's structure and the arrangement of content, which improves navigation.

Remember, HTML is meant to convey meaning, rather than presentation. Semantically meaningful content is reusable and more meaningful to assistive technologies.

Once everything is structured properly, you can move on to  {{% pattern "Clean up" %}}.
