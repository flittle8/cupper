**Strong** vs. **Bold**. *Emphasis* vs. *Italics*. What's the difference? And what should we do about it?

In HTML5, there are two types of "bold" - represented by the ```<strong>``` and the ```<b>``` elements. There also two types of "italics" - represented by the ```<em>``` and the ```<i>``` elements. Each of these elements convey different information to the reading system. If you're curious about their uses, you can explore the links in the [References](#references).

These four elements are often misused. Determining whether or not these elements have been applied correctly throughout the book is not only a laborious task, but, arguably, it's a job for the book's editor and not the book's remediators. Therefore, we're not going to worry about fixing up any code related to italics or bolding.
