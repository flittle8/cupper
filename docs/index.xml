      <title>Check the EPUB version</title>
      <link>https://flittle8.github.io/cupper/patterns/epub-2-to-epub-3/check-the-version/</link>

      <guid>https://flittle8.github.io/cupper/patterns/epub-2-to-epub-3/check-the-version/</guid>
      <description>This first step to editing an EPUB is to check what version of EPUB the book is. We want it to be an EPUB 3, and not an EPUB 2. If it&amp;rsquo;s an EPUB 2, then we need to upgrade it.
Follow the steps below to check what version of EPUB you&amp;rsquo;re working with.
Open the EPUB in Sigil There are very ways to do this: you can right-click on the EPUB and open with Sigil; you can open Sigil and then go to File &amp;gt; Open; you can open Sigil and press Command+O or âŒ˜O.</description>

      <description>The contents in this section are in no significant order - where you choose to begin is up to you. What&amp;rsquo;s important is that you check that each of these components are properly marked up in the book.
TALK ABOUT WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT
Our goal is to create a book that uses meaningful HTML markup to indicate page structure and text language. Meaningful HTML markup makes it easier for users of assistive technology to understand the book&amp;rsquo;s structure and the arrangement of content, which improves navigation.</description>

      <description>Before we can start editing an EPUB, we need to download a few tools. Follow the links below to get started:
 Sigil Sigil is an open source, multi-platform EPUB ebook editor. We&amp;rsquo;ll use Sigil to edit EPUBs. ePub3-itizer ePub3-itizer is a plug-in for Sigil that will convert an EPUB 2 into a EPUB 3. If you&amp;rsquo;re using a Mac, you&amp;rsquo;ll also need to download ActiveTcl for this plugin to work.</description>

      <title>Create a page list</title>
      <link>https://flittle8.github.io/cupper/patterns/epub-2-to-epub-3/create-pagelist/</link>

      <guid>https://flittle8.github.io/cupper/patterns/epub-2-to-epub-3/create-pagelist/</guid>
      <description>The first step, before we start the nitty-gritty of editing, is to create what&amp;rsquo;s called a &amp;ldquo;page list&amp;rdquo;.
A page list is exactly what it sounds like - a list of all the pages (or, &amp;ldquo;page breaks&amp;rdquo;) in the book. These pages correspond to pages in the print edition. The page list allows users in mixed print-digital environments, like classrooms and book clubs, to coordinate their reading. It&amp;rsquo;s a great navigational aid.</description>

      <title>Create an EPUB 3</title>

      <guid>https://flittle8.github.io/cupper/patterns/epub-2-to-epub-3/create-epub3/</guid>
      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re working with an EPUB 2, there&amp;rsquo;s now (hopefully) a page list in the NCX file, and we&amp;rsquo;re ready to upgrade this book to an EPUB 3.
Follow these 3 simple steps to generate an EPUB 3:
 Go to Plugins in the menu bar Click on Output Click on ePub3-itizer  Success!
Continue to  Structure &amp;#43; Semantics.</description>

      <description> It&amp;rsquo;s not required that you read or understand all about EPUB, HTML, et cetera. However, the below resources are a good place to start if you want to know more about the how&amp;rsquo;s and why&amp;rsquo;s of ebook creation and accessibility.

      <title>Blockquotes</title>
      <link>https://flittle8.github.io/cupper/patterns/structure-and-semantics/blockquotes/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://flittle8.github.io/cupper/patterns/structure-and-semantics/blockquotes/</guid>
      <description>A blockquote represents a section that is quoted from another source. It&amp;rsquo;s represented by the &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt; element.
Often times, you will see books that use the &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; or paragraph element, instead of the semantically correct &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;. This &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; element is often followed by a class=&amp;quot;quote&amp;quot; attribute, or a similiar class value (we&amp;rsquo;ll talk more about getting rid of classes later).
Using the &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; element when a more specific element is appropriate is a violation of the HTML specification.</description>

      <title>Bold and italics</title>

      <description>Strong vs. Bold. Emphasis vs. Italics. What&amp;rsquo;s the difference? And what should we do about it?
In HTML5, there are two types of &amp;ldquo;bold&amp;rdquo; - represented by the &amp;lt;strong&amp;gt; and the &amp;lt;b&amp;gt; elements. There also two types of &amp;ldquo;italics&amp;rdquo; - represented by the &amp;lt;em&amp;gt; and the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt; elements. Each of these elements conveys different information to the reading system. If you&amp;rsquo;re curious about their uses, you can explore the links in the References.</description>

      <title>Context breaks</title>
      <link>https://flittle8.github.io/cupper/patterns/structure-and-semantics/context-breaks/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://flittle8.github.io/cupper/patterns/structure-and-semantics/context-breaks/</guid>
      <description>A context break is a thematic break, such as, a scene change in a story, or a transition to another topic within a section of a book.
The &amp;lt;hr /&amp;gt;, or horizontal rule, element is used to represent a context break. The use of the hr element to indicate context breaks allows assistive technologies to inform users of this shift in thought, time, location, or similiar.
You may come across all sorts of different, and creative, ways that are used to denote a change in context in a book (see Examples).</description>

      <guid>https://flittle8.github.io/cupper/patterns/structure-and-semantics/lists/</guid>
      <description>If you come across a list of items in a book, you need to check that it&amp;rsquo;s tagged appropriately so that users can easily navigate through it. The ability to move quickly and effectively through long lists is a key reading need and often overlooked as an accessibility feature.
Sighted readers rarely notice the advantage of being able to quickly skim a list, determine if it&amp;rsquo;s of any interest and/or selectively read items.</description>

      <description>Each xhtml file in a book has a title. This title can be found at the top of the page in the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; element.
Meaningful titles allow readers to find and navigate to pages without having to first read them. Assistive technologies typically announce the title of each page when it&amp;rsquo;s first loaded in a user agent.
It&amp;rsquo;s commonplace to see just the title of the book in the &amp;lt;title&amp;gt; element on every xhtml page.</description>

      <title>Sections and headings</title>

      <description>Adding sections, asides, headings, and attributes Don&amp;rsquo;t be off-put by the heading, this is pretty straightforward.
For readers to be able to follow and understand the content, you need to clearly identify the sections of the book. Clearly grouping and identifying content enables better navigation by anyone reading using an assistive technology. To give the book a meaningful structure, follow the steps below.
1: Add a section or an aside element All the primary and secondary sections of a book need to be encapsulated in either a &amp;lt;section&amp;gt; or an &amp;lt;aside&amp;gt; element, respectively.</description>
