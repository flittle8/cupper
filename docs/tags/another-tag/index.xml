      <title>Blockquotes</title>
      <link>https://flittle8.github.io/cupper/patterns/structure-and-semantics/blockquotes/</link>

      <description>A blockquote represents a section that is quoted from another source. It&amp;rsquo;s represented by the &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt; element.
Often times, you will see books that use the &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; or paragraph element, instead of the semantically correct &amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;. This &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; element is often followed by a class=&amp;quot;quote&amp;quot; attribute, or a similiar class value (we&amp;rsquo;ll talk more about getting rid of classes later).
Using the &amp;lt;p&amp;gt; element when a more specific element is appropriate is a violation of the HTML specification.</description>

      <title>Check the EPUB version</title>
      <link>https://flittle8.github.io/cupper/patterns/epub-2-to-epub-3/check-the-version/</link>

      <guid>https://flittle8.github.io/cupper/patterns/epub-2-to-epub-3/check-the-version/</guid>
      <description>This first step to editing an EPUB is to check what version of EPUB the book is. We want it to be an EPUB 3, and not an EPUB 2. If it&amp;rsquo;s an EPUB 2, then we need to upgrade it.
Follow the steps below to check what version of EPUB you&amp;rsquo;re working with.
Open the EPUB in Sigil There are very ways to do this: you can right-click on the EPUB and open with Sigil; you can open Sigil and then go to File &amp;gt; Open; you can open Sigil and press Command+O or âŒ˜O.</description>

      <title>Introduction</title>

      <description>The contents in this section are in no significant order - where you choose to begin is up to you. What&amp;rsquo;s important is that you check that each of these components are properly marked up in the book.
TALK ABOUT WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT
Our goal is to create a book that uses meaningful HTML markup to indicate page structure and text language. Meaningful HTML markup makes it easier for users of assistive technology to understand the book&amp;rsquo;s structure and the arrangement of content, which improves navigation.</description>

      <title>Lists</title>
      <link>https://flittle8.github.io/cupper/patterns/structure-and-semantics/lists/</link>

      <guid>https://flittle8.github.io/cupper/patterns/structure-and-semantics/lists/</guid>
      <description>If you come across a list of items in a book, you need to check that it&amp;rsquo;s tagged appropriately so that users can easily navigate through it. The ability to move quickly and effectively through long lists is a key reading need and often overlooked as an accessibility feature.
Sighted readers rarely notice the advantage of being able to quickly skim a list, determine if it&amp;rsquo;s of any interest and/or selectively read items.</description>

      <title>Page titles</title>
      <link>https://flittle8.github.io/cupper/patterns/structure-and-semantics/page-titles/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://flittle8.github.io/cupper/patterns/structure-and-semantics/page-titles/</guid>
      <description>Each xhtml file in a book has a title. This title can be found at the top of the page in the &amp;lt;head&amp;gt; element.
Meaningful titles allow readers to find and navigate to pages without having to first read them. Assistive technologies typically announce the title of each page when it&amp;rsquo;s first loaded in a user agent.
It&amp;rsquo;s commonplace to see just the title of the book in the &amp;lt;title&amp;gt; element on every xhtml page.</description>
